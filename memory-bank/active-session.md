# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-17 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 01 - Exercise 03 (Unnecessary violence) - COMPLETED
- **Specific Issue:** Successfully implemented Weapon, HumanA, and HumanB classes with proper reference/pointer semantics

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// COMPLETED: cpp01/ex03 - HumanA/HumanB with references vs pointers
// Weapon class: fully implemented with const getType(), setType(), constructors, destructor
// HumanA: uses const Weapon& reference member, requires weapon in constructor
// HumanB: uses Weapon* pointer member, allows NULL initialization and setWeapon() method
// All classes compile successfully and demonstrate different object relationship patterns
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Exercise 03 is complete and working
- Student discovered the safety of initializing pointer members to NULL in initializer lists
- Ready to progress to next C++ Module 01 exercise (ex04, ex05, ex06) or advance to Module 02
- Strong understanding of reference vs pointer trade-offs in class design

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Successfully completed cpp01/ex03 with proper reference/pointer design patterns
- **HumanA Design**: Uses const Weapon& reference member, requires weapon in constructor, permanent relationship
- **HumanB Design**: Uses Weapon* pointer member, allows NULL initialization, flexible relationship via setWeapon()
- **Const-correctness mastery**: Fixed "type qualifiers not compatible" errors by making getType() const
- **Reference binding rules**: Discovered why const references bind to temporaries but non-const references don't
- **Pointer safety**: Learned that initializing pointer members to NULL in initializer lists is safe and flexible
- **Project constraints**: Successfully worked within constraint of jim.setWeapon(club) by using reference parameter
- **Memory management**: Clear understanding of when to use references vs pointers in class design
- **Object lifetime**: Solid grasp of how storage choice affects object relationships and mutability

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question**: "You've mastered the fundamentals of C++ object relationships. What interests you next: file I/O (ex04), function pointers (ex05), switch statements (ex06), or advancing to operator overloading (cpp02)?"
- **Reasoning**: Student has strong foundation and momentum, ready for next challenge with MVP approach
- **Backup Approaches**: Present concrete coding challenges to maintain hands-on learning momentum

## Session Notes:
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: ex03 completed successfully with deep understanding of design trade-offs
- Student articulated excellent hypotheses about reference/pointer behavior and tested them
- Maintained strong MVP/experimental approach throughout complex C++ concepts
- Ready for progression to more advanced C++ topics
- Should update progress.md with mastery evidence before advancing
