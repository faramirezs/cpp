# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-07-02 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 02 - Exercise 03 (BSP - Binary Space Partitioning) - Point-in-Triangle Algorithm
- **Specific Issue:** Completed BSP implementation using area-based triangle comparison method

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// COMPLETED: cpp02/ex03 - Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) point-in-triangle detection
// ACHIEVED: Area-based algorithm using coordinate formula
// MASTERED: Const-correctness with getter functions, area calculation, edge case handling
// CURRENT FOCUS: Session completed successfully, preparing for cpp03 Inheritance module
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- ‚úÖ Successfully implemented area calculation using coordinate formula
- ‚úÖ Mastered const member function requirements for const parameters
- ‚úÖ Understood area-based point-in-triangle algorithm (sum of sub-triangles equals original)
- ‚úÖ Implemented edge case detection (zero area = collinear points)
- ‚úÖ Simplified absolute value calculation (negation vs complex square root)
- üîÑ Session completed, ready to transition to cpp03 Inheritance

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **Algorithm Discovery**: Successfully discovered area-based approach for point-in-triangle detection
- **Mathematical Insight**: Understood that sum of sub-triangle areas equals original triangle area when point is inside
- **Const-correctness Mastery**: Figured out that const member functions are needed for const parameters
- **Edge Case Handling**: Recognized that zero area indicates collinear points (edges/vertices)
- **Code Simplification**: Chose simple negation over complex square root for absolute value
- **MVP Success**: Built working solution incrementally, testing each component
- **Geometric Understanding**: Grasped the relationship between triangle areas and point containment

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Next Session Focus**: Begin C++ Module 03 - Inheritance concepts
- **Key Topics**: Base/derived classes, constructor chains, virtual functions, polymorphism
- **Implementation Strategy**: Start with simple inheritance example and build complexity
- **Learning Goals**: Understand inheritance hierarchy, access specifiers, method overriding

## Session Notes:
- Smooth transition from ex01 completion to ex02 challenges
- Strong foundation in Fixed class implementation provides confidence for operator overloading
- Ready to tackle more complex operator patterns and multiple function signatures
- Should maintain MVP approach: implement and test operator categories one at a time
- Prepared to explore different operator overloading patterns (member vs non-member, return types, etc.)
- Should focus on testing and validation in next session before advancing
