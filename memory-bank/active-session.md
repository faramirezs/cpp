# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-24 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 01 - Exercise 05 (Harl 2.0) - Member Function Pointers
- **Specific Issue:** Learning to use pointers to member functions to call private methods dynamically based on string input

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// IN PROGRESS: cpp01/ex05 - Member function pointers in Harl class
// COMPLETED: cpp01/ex04 - File I/O with ifstream/ofstream, string replacement
// Current focus: std::find with arrays, mapping strings to function pointers
// Challenges: C++ documentation sources, algorithm includes, array searching techniques
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Successfully created member function pointers and can call them
- Working on dynamic function selection: mapping "debug" string to &Harl::debug function pointer
- Struggling with std::find usage and missing algorithm include
- Exploring array-based lookup vs other mapping approaches
- Understanding difference between C man pages and C++ documentation

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **File I/O Discovery**: Learned that C++ main() still uses C-style argc/argv, cannot use std::string* for argv
- **C++ vs C Documentation**: Discovered that C++ standard library documentation is not in man pages, found cppreference
- **ifstream/ofstream Learning**: Moved from C-style open()/read() to C++ stream objects for file handling
- **Member Function Pointers Breakthrough**: Successfully created and called pointers to private member functions
- **Access Control Mastery**: Discovered that public member functions can access private members within same class
- **Function Pointer Syntax**: Learned difference between &Harl::debug (function address) vs &(this->debug()) (result address)
- **Array vs Container Search**: Exploring std::find vs manual loops for string-to-function mapping
- **Dynamic Function Selection**: Working on mapping string parameters to appropriate function pointers
- **Algorithm Include Discovery**: Found missing #include <algorithm> needed for std::find

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question**: "What happens when you add #include <algorithm> and try std::find again? If that doesn't work, how would you write a simple loop to find the string index?"
- **Reasoning**: Guide discovery of either std::find solution or fallback to manual array search
- **Backup Approaches**: Explore alternative mapping strategies if current approach proves difficult

## Session Notes:
- Strong progression from ex03 → ex04 → ex05, building on previous concepts
- Excellent hypothesis-driven experimentation with member function pointers
- Maintained MVP approach while tackling advanced C++ features
- Ready to complete function pointer mapping and move to ex06 or beyond
- Should update progress.md with ex04 completion and ex05 progress
