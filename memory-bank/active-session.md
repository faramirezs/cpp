# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-27 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 02 - Exercise 02 (Advanced Operator Overloading) - Arithmetic and Comparison Operators  
- **Specific Issue:** Transitioning from basic Fixed class to comprehensive operator overloading implementation

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// COMPLETED: cpp02/ex01 - Complete Fixed-point class with all basic functionality
// ACHIEVED: All constructors, conversion methods, and insertion operator working
// IN PROGRESS: cpp02/ex02 - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (<, >, ==, etc.)
// CURRENT FOCUS: Multiple operator overloading patterns and return type decisions
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- ‚úÖ Successfully completed cpp02/ex01 with full functionality
- ‚úÖ Verified constructor behavior and debug output patterns
- ‚úÖ Understood initialization list vs assignment differences for simple types  
- üîÑ Starting cpp02/ex02: implementing multiple operator overloads
- üìã Need to understand return types and parameter patterns for different operator categories

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **ex01 Completion Success**: Successfully finished cpp02/ex01 with all required functionality
- **Constructor Implementation**: Completed int/float constructors with proper debug messages and fixed-point conversion
- **Precision Understanding**: Mastered roundf() usage for float-to-fixed-point conversion accuracy
- **Testing Validation**: Verified complete Fixed class functionality through comprehensive test cases
- **Code Quality**: Clean implementation with proper const-correctness and initialization patterns
- **Mathematical Confidence**: Solid understanding of fixed-point arithmetic and floating-point precision limitations
- **Debug Output Patterns**: Understood constructor/destructor message expectations and verification
- **Transition Readiness**: Successfully moved from ex01 completion to ex02 operator overloading challenges

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Next Session Focus**: Implement arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, etc.)
- **Key Question**: "Looking at all these operators, which ones should return a new Fixed object vs which should return bool values?"
- **Implementation Strategy**: Guide discovery of different operator categories and their return type patterns
- **Testing Approach**: Build operators incrementally and test each category before moving to the next

## Session Notes:
- Smooth transition from ex01 completion to ex02 challenges
- Strong foundation in Fixed class implementation provides confidence for operator overloading
- Ready to tackle more complex operator patterns and multiple function signatures
- Should maintain MVP approach: implement and test operator categories one at a time
- Prepared to explore different operator overloading patterns (member vs non-member, return types, etc.)
- Should focus on testing and validation in next session before advancing
