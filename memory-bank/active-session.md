# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-13 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 01 ex03 - Unnecessary violence (Weapon/Human classes)
- **Specific Issue:** Understanding when to use references vs pointers in class design

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// Completed cpp01/ex02 - References vs Pointers demonstration
// Working on cpp01/ex03 - Weapon/HumanA/HumanB classes
// HumanA.hpp: Started class structure, need to integrate Weapon
// Focus: HumanA takes weapon by reference, HumanB can set weapon later
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Successfully completed ex02 with references vs pointers understanding
- Starting ex03 with class design decisions: reference vs pointer for weapon
- Need to understand why HumanA uses reference (always has weapon) vs HumanB uses pointer (optional weapon)
- Understanding constructor initialization with references vs setter methods with pointers

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **ex02 Completed:** Successfully implemented string pointer and reference demonstration
- **Reference Understanding:** Solid grasp of references as aliases vs pointers as addresses
- **Ready for Design Decisions:** Understanding when to choose reference vs pointer in real-world scenarios
- **Learning Pattern:** Continues to excel with hands-on implementation and discovery

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question:** "Looking at the requirements, HumanA takes a weapon by reference in constructor, but HumanB can set weapon later. What do you think that tells us about when each human gets their weapon?"
- **Reasoning:** Help discover the design reasoning behind reference vs pointer choice
- **Backup Approaches:** Use real-world analogies about permanent vs temporary tool assignment

## Session Notes:
- Student showing excellent progression through cpp01 exercises
- References vs pointers concepts mastered through practical implementation
- Ready to apply knowledge to real design decisions
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind reference vs pointer choices
- Prepare foundation for method implementation and weapon interaction patterns
