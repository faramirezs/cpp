# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-16 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 01 - Exercise 03 (Unnecessary violence)
- **Specific Issue:** Implementing Weapon class methods and completing HumanA/HumanB exercise

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// IN PROGRESS: cpp01/ex03 - HumanA/HumanB with references vs pointers
// Current state: Weapon.hpp declared, Weapon.cpp needs implementation
// Need to implement: getType(), setType(), constructors for Weapon class
// Then complete: HumanA and HumanB classes with different weapon storage patterns
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Need to implement Weapon class methods (getType, setType, constructors)
- Weapon.cpp currently only has include statement
- Ready to continue with MVP hands-on implementation approach
- HumanA/HumanB classes waiting for Weapon implementation to be completed

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **ex03 Status:** Weapon.hpp is declared but Weapon.cpp needs implementation
- **Current Task:** Implement getType(), setType(), and constructors for Weapon class
- **Learning Focus:** Understanding class methods, getters/setters, and constructor patterns
- **MVP Approach:** Ready for immediate hands-on coding of Weapon methods

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question:** "Looking at your Weapon.hpp, what do you think the getType() method should return and why does it return a const reference?"
- **Reasoning:** Guide discovery of getter method implementation and const reference benefits
- **Backup Approaches:** Explore memory efficiency and string handling through practical implementation

## Session Notes:
- Corrected: ex03 is NOT completed - still working on Weapon class implementation
- Student has good class structure in place (Weapon.hpp)
- Ready to implement methods with hands-on approach
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical explanations
