# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-07-03 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 04 - Exercise 01 (Abstract Classes & Deep Copy) - Brain Class Implementation
- **Specific Issue:** Transitioning from basic inheritance to advanced memory management with deep copy semantics

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// COMPLETED: cpp04/ex00 - Basic polymorphism with Animal/Dog/Cat hierarchy
// ACHIEVED: Virtual function overriding, const-correctness, inheritance chains
// COMPLETED: cpp03/ex00-ex02 - ClapTrap/ScavTrap/FragTrap inheritance with proper construction/destruction chaining
// IN PROGRESS: cpp04/ex01 - Brain class with dynamic memory management and deep copy requirements
// CURRENT FOCUS: Deep copy semantics and memory leak prevention
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- ‚úÖ Successfully completed cpp04/ex00 with virtual function polymorphism
- ‚úÖ Mastered inheritance construction/destruction chaining in cpp03
- ‚úÖ Understood const member function requirements and virtual function behavior
- ‚úÖ Debugged segmentation faults through systematic MVP testing approach
- üîÑ Starting cpp04/ex01: Brain class with dynamic memory allocation and deep copy semantics
- ÔøΩ Need to understand: private Brain* attributes, deep vs shallow copy, destructor chains with dynamic memory

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **Inheritance Mastery**: Successfully completed cpp03 module with proper constructor/destruction chaining
- **Virtual Function Understanding**: Mastered virtual function overriding and polymorphic behavior in cpp04/ex00
- **Debugging Excellence**: Systematically debugged segmentation faults using MVP isolation techniques
- **Const-correctness Application**: Applied const member functions correctly for polymorphic interfaces
- **Memory Debugging**: Used step-by-step testing to isolate crash locations and identify root causes
- **Inheritance Chain Validation**: Verified proper construction/destruction order in derived classes
- **Polymorphism Implementation**: Successfully implemented Animal/Dog/Cat hierarchy with virtual functions
- **Problem Isolation Skills**: Learned to test individual components before combining complex functionality

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Next Session Focus**: Implement Brain class with dynamic memory allocation
- **Key Question**: "What's the difference between shallow copy and deep copy when your class contains a pointer?"
- **Implementation Strategy**: Build Brain class first, then integrate with Dog/Cat, test deep copy behavior
- **Memory Management Goal**: Understand RAII principles and prevent memory leaks in inheritance hierarchies
- **Testing Approach**: Create Animal array, test proper destruction order, verify no memory leaks

## Session Notes:
- Strong progression from cpp02 fixed-point arithmetic through cpp03 inheritance to cpp04 polymorphism
- Excellent debugging methodology: isolate, test incrementally, verify assumptions
- Ready for advanced memory management concepts: dynamic allocation, deep copy, RAII
- Should maintain MVP approach: implement Brain class first, then integration, then deep copy testing
- Prepared to explore complex destructor chains with dynamic memory cleanup
- Focus on understanding ownership semantics and copy constructor requirements
