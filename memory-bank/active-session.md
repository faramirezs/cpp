# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-16 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 01 - Exercise 03 (Unnecessary violence)
- **Specific Issue:** Deep dive into references, const-correctness, object lifetimes, and class design for Weapon, HumanA, and HumanB

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// IN PROGRESS: cpp01/ex03 - HumanA/HumanB with references vs pointers
// Weapon class implemented with getType() const, setType(), constructors, destructor
// HumanA and HumanB under test for reference/pointer/copy semantics
// Focus on: const-correctness, reference binding, lvalue/rvalue, and object lifetime
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Why does C++ allow const references to bind to temporaries but not non-const references?
- What is a non-const lvalue?
- Why do reference members require initialization in the initializer list?
- Why does storing a reference/copy/pointer in HumanA/HumanB affect object lifetime and behavior?
- How to avoid "object has type qualifiers that are not compatible with the member function" errors?
- How to design HumanB to allow weapon to be set after construction (pointer vs reference)?

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- Explored difference between returning by value and by reference in getType()
- Discovered why const-correctness is required for member functions called on const objects
- Investigated why reference members must be initialized in the initializer list
- Analyzed object lifetimes: why HumanA/HumanB may reference destroyed/copy objects
- Clarified lvalue, rvalue, and reference binding rules
- Discussed why C++ allows const references to bind to temporaries but not non-const references
- Experimented with pointer vs reference vs copy for HumanA/HumanB weapon storage
- Diagnosed "object has type qualifiers that are not compatible with the member function" and assignment to const member errors

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- "What is the safest way to store a weapon in HumanB if you want to allow changing the weapon after construction? Pointer, reference, or copy? Why?"
- "How does the choice of reference, pointer, or copy affect the lifetime and mutability of the weapon in HumanA and HumanB?"
- "What do you predict will happen if you try to set a reference member after construction? Why does C++ require initialization in the initializer list?"

## Session Notes:
- Student is actively experimenting and articulating discoveries about C++ references, const, and object lifetimes
- Strong MVP/code-first approach maintained
- Next: finalize HumanA/HumanB design and test with various weapon lifetimes and mutability scenarios
