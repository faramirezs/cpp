# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-06-26 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** C++ Module 02 - Exercise 01 (Fixed Point Class) - Operator Overloading
- **Specific Issue:** Understanding insertion operator overloading (operator<<) for floating-point representation output

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// IN PROGRESS: cpp02/ex01 - Fixed-point class with operator overloading
// COMPLETED: cpp02/ex00 - Basic Fixed class with canonical form
// Current focus: Insertion operator (<<) overloading for output stream
// Challenge: Understanding "floating-point representation" output requirement
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Has implemented basic Fixed class with toFloat() and toInt() conversion methods
- Needs to understand insertion operator overloading concept
- Question: "An overload of the insertion (<<) operator that inserts a floating-point representation of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as a parameter"
- Ready to learn practical operator overloading implementation

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- **Fixed Point Implementation**: Working on cpp02 ex01 Fixed class with conversion methods
- **Canonical Form Understanding**: Completed ex00 with basic Fixed class structure  
- **Method Implementation**: Successfully implemented toFloat() and toInt() conversion methods
- **Operator Overloading Introduction**: Ready to learn insertion operator (<<) overloading concept
- **Stream Output Challenge**: Need to understand "floating-point representation" output requirement
- **MVP Approach**: Following incremental complexity building from basic class to operator overloading

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question**: "When you write std::cout << someObject, what do you think the << operator is actually doing? How does it know how to display your custom Fixed object?"
- **Reasoning**: Guide discovery of operator<< as a function that connects objects to output streams
- **Backup Approaches**: Use familiar examples like std::cout << 42 to build understanding before introducing custom overloading

## Session Notes:
- Transition from cpp01 member function pointers to cpp02 operator overloading
- Strong foundation in class implementation and method definition
- Ready to explore operator overloading as extension of class design concepts
- Should maintain hands-on MVP approach with immediate coding exercises
