# Student Profile

**Student Identifier (if known):** alejiri

## Declared Learning Goals:
- Strengthen foundational programming concepts in C (aligned with 42 Coding School curriculum)
- Gain fluency with algorithmic problem solving

## Preferred Learning Style Hints (Observed or Stated):
- **Strongly prefers MVP approach**: Wants to jump into coding immediately, even without full conceptual understanding
- **Iterative complexity building**: Start with tiny functional MVP, then gradually increase complexity
- **One feature at a time**: As soon as MVP works, immediately move to next complexity level, adding one feature per interaction
- **Strategic planning**: Likes to plan the incremental steps before implementation to ensure logical progression
- **Hands-on learning**: Learns best through project-based tasks, code challenges, and hands-on problem solving
- **Step-by-step breakdowns**: Benefits from incremental feature additions rather than theory-first approach
- **Practical before theory**: Prefers to implement basic functionality first, then understand the deeper concepts
- **Code-first responses**: When asked questions, prefers to answer by writing code rather than explaining theoretically
- **Learning through imperfect attempts**: Comfortable writing code even when not completely sure, learns through iteration and correction
- **Challenge-oriented**: Wants to be challenged to write code as soon as opportunities arise
- **Show-and-iterate workflow**: Prefers to show code first, get quick practical feedback, then iterate rapidly
- **Momentum-focused**: Values keeping coding momentum high with immediate, actionable feedback over detailed explanations
- **Test-driven validation**: Likes to compile and test frequently to validate progress
- **Example**: For sandbox problem, wants to start with basic child process execution, then add signal handling later

## Known Strengths (Observed):
- High self-motivation and discipline

## Potential Areas for Gentle Nudging/Support:
- Actively working on building a technical foundation to transition into software engineering via 42 Coding School Berlin
