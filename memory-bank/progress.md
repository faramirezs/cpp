- **Concept: Class Design with References vs Pointers**
  - **Status:** In Progress (2025-06-16)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Working on ex03 HumanA/HumanB implementation. Weapon.hpp created with proper structure, need to implement Weapon.cpp methods (getType, setType, constructors).
- **Concept: Constructor Parameter Design**
  - **Status:** In Progress (2025-06-16)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Understanding class method implementation patterns through Weapon class development.
