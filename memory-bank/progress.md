  - **Evidence/Notes:** Successfully implemented megaphone.cpp with iostream, toupper, and proper string handling
- **Concept: Class Definition & Basic Methods**
  - **Status:** Developing (Last session: 2025-06-11)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Implemented contact and phonebook classes with constructors, getters, and basic encapsulation. Shows understanding of public/private access.
- **Concept: Static Members & Methods**
  - **Status:** Introduced (Last session: 2025-06-11)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Working with Account class static variables. Needs deeper understanding of static vs instance concepts.
- **Concept: Constructor/Destructor Lifecycle**
  - **Status:** Developing (Last session: 2025-06-11)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Implemented basic constructors, working on understanding object lifetime and memory management.

### C++ Module 01 - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
- **Concept: Stack vs Heap Allocation**
  - **Status:** Mastered (2025-06-11)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Successfully implemented newZombie (heap) and randomChump (stack). Understands automatic stack cleanup vs manual heap management.
