Chapter I

Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
for learning OOP, but we decided to choose C++ since it's derived from your old friend
C. Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.

We are aware that modern C++ is quite different in many aspects. So, if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it is up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

Chapter II

General rules

Compiling

• Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror

• Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98

Formatting and naming conventions

• The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ... , exn

• Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in

the guidelines.

• Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will

always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.

• Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character

and be displayed to the standard output.

• Goodbye Norminette! No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that code your peer evaluators can't
understand is code they can't grade. Do your best to write clean and readable code.

Allowed/Forbidden

You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

• You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use the C++-ish versions
of the C functions you are used to as much as possible.

• However, you can't use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
that's it.

C++ - Module 02

Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and the Orthodox Canonical class form

• Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and

friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.

• You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09. That means:
no Containers (vector/list/map, and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that
requires including the <algorithm> header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
be -42.

A few design requirements

• Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using the new

keyword), you must avoid memory leaks.

• From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox

Canonical Form, except when explicitly stated otherwise.

• Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)

means 0 to the exercise.

• You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will
be 0.

Read me

• You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory files.

• Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show

requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.

• Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.

• By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

Regarding the Makefile for C++ projects, the same rules as in C apply
(see the Norm chapter about the Makefile).

You will have to implement a lot of classes.

Chapter III

New rules

From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. They will then implement the four required member
functions below:

• Default constructor

• Copy constructor

• Copy assignment operator

• Destructor

Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class

definition, whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation.

Exercise 00: My First Class in
Orthodox Canonical Form

Exercise : 00

My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form

Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Forbidden functions : None

You think you know integers and floating-point numbers. How cute.

Please read this 3 pages article (1, 2, 3) to discover that you don't. Go on, read it.

Until today, every number you used in your code was basically either an integer or a
floating-point number, or any of their variants (short, char, long, double, and so forth).
After reading the article above, it's safe to assume that integers and floating-point num-
bers have opposite characteristics.

But today, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: fixed-point numbers! Forever missing from the scalar types of most languages,
fixed-point numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and
precision. That explains why fixed-point numbers are particularly applicable to computer
graphics, sound processing or scientific programming, just to name a few.

As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, you're going to add them. This article from

C++ - Module 02

Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and the Orthodox Canonical class form

Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:

• Private members:

◦ An integer to store the fixed-point number value.

◦ A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value

will always be the integer literal 8.

• Public members:

◦ A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.

◦ A copy constructor.

◦ A copy assignment operator overload.

◦ A destructor.

◦ A member function int getRawBits( void ) const;
that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.

◦ A member function void setRawBits( int const raw );

that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.

Running this code:

#include <iostream>

int

main( void ) {

Fixed a;
Fixed b( a );
Fixed c;

c = b;

std::cout << a.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << b.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << c.getRawBits() << std::endl;

return 0;

}

Should output something similar to:

$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called // <-- This line may be missing depending on your implementation
getRawBits member function called
Default constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
getRawBits member function called

Exercise 01: Towards a more useful
fixed-point number class

Exercise 01

Towards a more useful fixed-point number class

Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)

The previous exercise was a good start, but our class is pretty useless. It can only

represent the value 0.0.

Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:

• A constructor that takes a constant integer as a parameter.

It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value
should be initialized to 8, like in exercise 00.

• A constructor that takes a constant floating-point number as a parameter.

It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value
should be initialized to 8, like in exercise 00.

• A member function float toFloat( void ) const;

that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.

• A member function int toInt( void ) const;

that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.

And add the following function to the Fixed class files:

• An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as a parameter.

C++ - Module 02

Running this code:

#include <iostream>

int

main( void ) {

a;

Fixed
Fixed const b( 10 );
Fixed const c( 42.42f );
Fixed const d( b );

a = Fixed( 1234.4321f );

std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;

std::cout << "a is " << a.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;

return 0;

}

Should output something similar to:

$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Int constructor called
Float constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Float constructor called

Exercise 02: Now we're talking

Exercise 02

Now we're talking

Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)

Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:

• The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, and !=.

• The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.

• The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
post-decrement) operators, which will increase or decrease the fixed-point value by
the smallest representable ϵ, such that 1 + ϵ > 1.

Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:

• A static member function min that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as

parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

• A static member function min that takes two references to constant fixed-point

numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

• A static member function max that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as

parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

• A static member function max that takes two references to constant fixed-point

numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

C++ - Module 02

Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and the Orthodox Canonical class form

It's up to you to test every feature of your class. However, running the code below:

#include <iostream>

int

main( void ) {

Fixed
Fixed const

a;
b( Fixed( 5.05f ) * Fixed( 2 ) );

std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;

std::cout << b << std::endl;

std::cout << Fixed::max( a, b ) << std::endl;

return 0;

}

Should output something like (for greater readability, the constructor/destructor mes-

sages are removed in the example below):

$> ./a.out
0
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.0078125
10.1016
10.1016
$>

If you ever do a division by 0, it is acceptable that the program
crashes

Exercise 03: BSP

Exercise 03

BSP

Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp,
Point.{h, hpp}, Point.cpp, bsp.cpp
Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)

Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.

Implement a function that indicates whether a point is inside a triangle or not. Very

useful, isn't it?

BSP stands for Binary Space Partitioning.

You are welcome.

You can pass this module without completing exercise 03.

C++ - Module 02

Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and the Orthodox Canonical class form

Let's start by creating the Point class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents

a 2D point:

• Private members:

◦ A Fixed const attribute x.

◦ A Fixed const attribute y.

◦ Anything else useful.

• Public members:

◦ A default constructor that initializes x and y to 0.

◦ A constructor that takes two constant floating-point numbers as parameters.

It initializes x and y with those parameters.

◦ A copy constructor.

◦ A copy assignment operator overload.

◦ A destructor.

◦ Anything else useful.

To conclude, implement the following function in the appropriate file:

bool bsp( Point const a, Point const b, Point const c, Point const point);

• a, b, c: The vertices of our beloved triangle.

• point: The point to check.

• Returns: True if the point is inside the triangle. False otherwise.
Thus, if the point is a vertex or on an edge, it will return False.

Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure that your class behaves as expected.

Submission and Peer-Evaluation

Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don't hesitate to double-check the names
of your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
