/* The Character possesses an inventory of 4 slots, which means at most 4 Materias.
The inventory is empty upon construction. They equip the Materias in the first empty
slot they find, in the following order: from slot 0 to slot 3. If they try to add a Materia to
a full inventory, or use/unequip a non-existent Materia, nothing should happen (but bugs
are still forbidden). The unequip() member function must NOT delete the Materia! */
